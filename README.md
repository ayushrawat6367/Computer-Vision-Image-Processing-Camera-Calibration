# Computer-Vision-Image-Processing-Camera-Calibration

About:
Camera calibration is a crucial process in computer vision and image processing that involves determining the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera. These parameters are essential for understanding how the camera captures images and for performing accurate geometric transformations between the 3D world and the 2D image plane.

Project Tasks:

Rotation Matrix Calculation:
Design a program to calculate the rotation matrix from xyz to XYZ and vice versa.
Input: Angles of rotation (α, β, γ) in degrees.
Output: Rotation matrices for both transformations.

Camera Calibration:
Implement functions to extract image coordinates, world coordinates, intrinsic parameters (fx, fy, ox, oy), and extrinsic parameters (R, T) using a checkerboard image.
Input: Checkerboard image with known dimensions.
Output: Intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters.
